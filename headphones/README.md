## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a static website built with HTML and CSS that presents a sleek and modern design for a headphones brand. The project emphasizes responsive design, clean code, and excellent user experience across all device sizes.

**Repository:** `alx_html_css`  
**Directory:** `headphones`  
**Main File:** `README.md`

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design** – Seamlessly adapts from desktop to mobile devices
- **Modern Aesthetics** – Clean, professional design with contemporary styling
- **Interactive Elements** – Smooth hover and active states for enhanced user feedback
- **Optimized Performance** – Lightweight and fast-loading pages
- **Accessibility** – Semantic HTML structure for better screen reader support
- **Mobile-First Approach** – Optimized experience for all screen sizes

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette

The design utilizes a carefully chosen color scheme that reflects the premium nature of the headphones brand:

- **Primary Accent Color** – `#FF6565` (used for links and interactive elements on hover/active states)
- **Background & Neutral Tones** – Supporting colors for layout and typography

### Typography

Two custom fonts are used throughout the project to create a distinctive visual identity:

- **Source Sans Pro** – Primary font for body text and general content
- **Spin Cycle OT** – Accent font for headlines and special elements

**Note:** If your system doesn't have these fonts installed, download them and add them to your project fonts folder. They are essential for maintaining the design integrity.

### Layout Constraints

- **Maximum Content Width:** `1000px`
- **Centering:** All content is centered within the viewport using flexbox or margin auto
- **Padding:** Consistent spacing maintained throughout for visual rhythm

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx_html_css.git
   cd alx_html_css/headphones
   ```

2. **Install Custom Fonts**
   - Download `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT` from your preferred font source
   - Place them in a `fonts/` directory within the project
   - Link them in your CSS using `@font-face` declarations

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser, or
   - Use a local server for development:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     # or
     npx http-server
     ```

4. **View the Project**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

The website is designed with a mobile-first approach and includes a critical breakpoint:

**Mobile Layout (480px and below)**
- Full-width content with adjusted padding
- Optimized touch targets for mobile interaction
- Stacked navigation and layout elements
- Readable font sizes optimized for smaller screens

**Desktop Layout (480px and above)**
- Multi-column layouts where appropriate
- Expanded navigation menus
- Enhanced spacing and visual hierarchy
- Optimized for mouse and keyboard interaction

### Implementation

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  /* Mobile styles override base styles */
  body {
    padding: 1rem;
  }
}
```

## 🖱️ Interactive Elements

### Link Interactions

All links respond to user interaction with visual feedback:

- **Hover State:** Links change to `#FF6565` with smooth transition
- **Active State:** Maintains `#FF6565` color while the link is active
- **Transition:** Smooth color transitions for polished feel

```css
a {
  color: /* default color */;
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

a:hover,
a:active {
  color: #FF6565;
}
```

### Button Interactions

Buttons provide tactile feedback through opacity changes:

- **Default State:** Full opacity (1)
- **Hover State:** `opacity: 0.9` for subtle visual feedback
- **Active State:** `opacity: 0.9` while being clicked
- **Transition:** Smooth opacity transition for refined interaction

```css
button {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover,
button:active {
  opacity: 0.9;
}
```

## 🔤 Fonts & Typography

### Font Implementation

To ensure the custom fonts display correctly across all devices:

1. **Download the Fonts**
   - Source Sans Pro: Available from Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts
   - Spin Cycle OT: Available from appropriate font repositories

2. **Add to Project**
   ```
   project/
   ├── fonts/
   │   ├── SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf
   │   ├── SourceSansPro-Bold.ttf
   │   ├── SpinCycleOT-Regular.ttf
   │   └── SpinCycleOT-Bold.ttf
   ```

3. **CSS Declaration**
   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: 'Source Sans Pro';
     src: url('../fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
     font-weight: normal;
   }

   @font-face {
     font-family: 'Spin Cycle OT';
     src: url('../fonts/SpinCycleOT-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
     font-weight: normal;
   }
   ```

### Font Values

Some font size and spacing values may include decimals. These can be rounded to the nearest whole number for practical implementation without significant visual impact.
